                <h2>About My Site</h2>
                <p>My proposal for this site is a website for a fictional recording studio called <b>Drop D Records</b>. The purpose of the site will be to inform any potential clients of what services the company offers and how you can find out more.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>The target audience for this site is any musicians who do not have a place to record their music. We want customers who will be willing to come any and record their tracks.</p>
                <h3>Persona</h3>
                <h4>Ben</h4>
                <p>Ben is a guitar player who has written a few songs. He has recorded some rough takes of his songs with his laptop, but he would like a place where he can record more professional sounding tracks. He is looking for a place with state-of-the-art equipment and people who can help him make his music sound great. He is also looking for a professional looking company instead of some hole-in-the-wall place.</p>
