            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>In class, we were asked to spend 24 hours browsing on a mobile device instead of a computer. We were supposed to see how well these sites translated to a small phone screen instead of the normal computer screen and report.</p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Some sites were zoomed in and made navigation easy. Most, however were clearly not built with mobile in mind. They were usually in a similar format as the computer version, which requires zooming in in order to even read the navigation links among other things.</p>
            <p>An example of a site doing this poorly is <a href="https://store.lds.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategories1?langId=-1&storeId=715839595&catalogId=10557">store.lds.org</a>.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>If you are used to a specific site or app and then try it out on the phone, you may be disappointed that it is much harder to navigate and locate things. I was kind of impressed with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. It is designed more or less the same as the mobile app. Obviously the app is a little more user friendly. They are hoping that you will uae that versus the browser. But they still obviously put effort into the mobile browser version. </p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>On most sites, you can still do what you need to. The ease of doing this varies, but it possible. I found that <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website</a> did this very well. While the Apple Store does have a mobile app, I actually find their browser version to be better. It works just like the full computer version only scaled down. It is easy to find and do whatever you need to.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is ridiculous on mobile. This is because it doesn't exist. You want to use Twitter? You have to download the app. They didn't even try to make a browser version. They just gave up and took the easy way out.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p><a href="http://google.com">Google</a> is an amazing website. And it lives up to that on mobile browsers. Unlike most other websites that have a corresponding app, they didn't shortchange the browser version just to get you to download the app. I've tried the Google app before, and I personally like using the browser instead. I use this site daily and it's so quick easy to find information you need.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I learned how important it is to take the mobile version of your site into consideration when designing. Several big name websites haven't focused on this at all. With practically everyone having a smartphone, it's a necessity. I was truly surprised at how many websites don't focus on the mobile browser.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://store.lds.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategories1?langId=-1&storeId=715839595&catalogId=10557">LDS Store</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a></li>
